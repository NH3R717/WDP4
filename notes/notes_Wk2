Total – 36 hours

Instructor wireframe critique points –

  fonts – specific fonts chosen for header/footer (helvetica (en)/Yanti TC (tw) and body content (Constantia (en)/Weibei (tw)

  social media icons – yes, visual presence reduced. though facebook being this business’s current main online presence along with Line for communication, it is advantageous to display these icon prominently 

  footer – the primary viewing of this site will likely be on mobile where users can to find pertinent and basic information quickly and easily. header menu will provide jump options to specific points on the page providing redundant navigation. due to the simplicity of the page, contact info in a footer doesn’t seem logical when the site consist of one page and reaching that info is with in 4-6 screen lengths.

  multi lingual – exactly, there is a push by the local governments here for local business to be tourist friendly, a multi lingual page (Japanese/ Korean/ etc. could easily be integrated) goes a long way towards this. it would help this business attract tourist revenue as well as may act be an advantage when trying to attract partners, get permits from the local government or acquire financing

  reservations – this restaurant does not currently take reservations nor is the type that will likely in the future. a conscious decision to keep the page as simple as possible was made with most of the c2b and b2b initial communications being done through FB messenger or Line. including a form page for example would be something the owner would likely not receive much traffic from and would also not be something they would not want to keep track of. messenger/ phone /email options are sufficient.
