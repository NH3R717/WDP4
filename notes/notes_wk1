As a US Navy veteran working as a photographer/propulsion systems engineer and as a US Merchant Marine specializing in refrigeration systems engineering I have spent most of my adult life working, living and traveling all over the world. Post these two working situations for the last 7 years I have been traveling and living in East Asia, primarily China (PRC) & Hong Kong, as an engineering training consultant and am currently spending my time studying at Full Sail online in Taiwan (which is not China).

My primary desired outcome from studying with Full Sail is gain the knowledge in helping companies to develop their app based training needs with cutting edge skills in web app development. Working with these companies to help them develop their app based training platforms previously I had noticed their general lacking in implementation of modern app based solutions and realized I could fill a very valuable niche if I advanced my abilities in app development and design.

With a ski trip planned to Korea next week I am working on front loading my assignment requirements as much as possible. I feel a lot of the topics covered this month I already have basic knowledge in (I have purchased and own .com domains from name.com in the past and also currently run 2 VPSs, one on digitalocean.com and vultr.com) being ahead of entry level knowledge on these subjects will allow me to easily learn and implement more advanced related solutions for them this month. I've opted to keep my task list in checkbox form on a text document in my project folder (included in this post). I find this to be a simple and elegant solution as it is always available in VS Code when I have it open and I don't have to add another app to my work flow. I keep meaning to research if there is a task list extension available in VS Code but haven't yet (probably do that in the next few minutes).

As for that actual content of this months project I have decided to produce a single page static site for my good friend's restaurant located here in Taiwan. Visiting his restaurant I am impressed into the effort put in to his product branding and its location interior styling (especially when compared to similar tier restaurants), but this restaurant's web presents is non existent, save for a Facebook page. Researching restaurant webpage designs I've found a link (https://webdesignledger.com/restaurant-websites-to-inspire-you/) listing various restaurant pages which has been a good starting point to for giving me inspiration to my page design.

Another issue with my friends business that I've noticed is his use of gmail as a professional business email. I currently use Proton Mail to host my domain email but feel like the services offered by it are excessive for my friends needs and thus he would be incurring unnecessary cost by using it. https://mailbox.org offers services and pricing (€1) more inline with my friends needs so I will be looking to what it takes to set up a custom domain account for him with that.

Kevin,

Your mention of Figma had me look into it spend some extra time checking into it. I've been using Adobe products for a while and my go to app for designing the wire frames for this month's project was going to be illustrator. But actually I been looking for an alternative to AI, even though FS provides students with education licenses for Adobe CC I really have no use for most of the features it provides and find its U/X cumbersome overall. So my research into AI alternatives on Mac lead me to Affinity Designer. I was apprehensive about switching before but after trying it out I haven't found a feature I need it doesn't have that AI does and over it's a much more focused and user friendly product. I look forward to using it for my future vector design needs. – Tommy

Holly,

Checking you link on OpenAPI link I am curious as to how/if you plan on implementing custom APIs into your project. Your response might give me some idea as to whether adding something similar to my project this month or in future projects might be beneficial, thanks. – Tommy
